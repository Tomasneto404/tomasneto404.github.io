## Why Document the Network?
1. Troubleshooting
When up-to-date network documentation is available, identifying the source of an issue becomes much faster. Instead of wasting time searching for unknown configurations or missing details, technicians can rely on existing records and focus directly on the root cause. This reduces downtime and boosts overall efficiency.

2. Reproduce Setups
Documenting the network makes it easy to recreate configurations consistently, whether expanding infrastructure, migrating services, or building test environments. Having all settings, versions, and parameters recorded helps prevent human error and ensures new setups behave exactly like the original.

3. Learning
Documentation serves as a valuable knowledge base for new team members and even for experienced administrators who need to revisit details. It helps everyone understand the architecture, patterns, and technical decisions, reducing the learning curve and increasing autonomy.

4. Automation
Automation depends on knowing how the network is structured and how each component behaves. With well-organized documentation, it becomes possible to create scripts and tools that operate safely and predictably. This reduces manual work, minimizes errors, and standardizes processes.

5. Compliance
Many standards and regulations require clear records of the IT infrastructure. Documentation helps demonstrate compliance, streamline audits, and ensure the network meets legal and security requirements. It also makes it easier to update policies and keep the environment aligned with best practices.

## My Network (For now)

### Machines
- **NAS**
This is my main Network Attached Storage server. It is where i store my backups, private files, media library, and everything that a i need.
-**Main Server**
This is the brain of the whole setup.
